This is a one-off Halloween project.

The app lets user "choose your adventure" by picking emojis and adding captions. The users will use QR code to pass the game to the next person.

In the end, LLM will generate a poem based on users choices.

Due to the cost of hosing LLMs, the poem generator feature is disabled from the backend. You will need to self-host a LLM for this to work.
